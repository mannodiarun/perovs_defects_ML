# perovs_defects_ML

This repo contains density functional theory (DFT) computed point defect formation energies and charge transition levels for 265 data points across 4 hybrid halide perovskite compounds (MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, MAPbBr1.5Cl1.5, MAPbCl3), and scripts to train and optimize machine learning models (neural network, random forest, Gaussian process) from the DFT data using descriptors based on tabulated elemental properties and defect coordination environment. A second branch contains linear models with Pearson correlation coefficients and compound features to predict some properties.
